<p><span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of these verses
dealing with the war were written in France during my recent
seven months&rsquo; sojourn there, and for the purpose of using
in entertainments given in camps and hospitals to thousands of
American soldiers.</p>
<p>They were the result of coming into close contact with the
soldiers&rsquo; mind and heart, and were intentionally expressed
in the simplest manner, without any consideration of methods
approved by modern critics.&nbsp; The fact that I have been asked
to autograph scores of copies of many of these verses (and one of
them to the extent of 350 copies) is more gratifying to me than
would be the highest encomiums of the purely literary critic.</p>

1</span>THANKSGIVING</h2>
<p class="poetry">Thanksgiving for the strong armed day,<br />
That lifted war&rsquo;s red curse,<br />
When Peace, that lordly little word,<br />
Was uttered in a voice that stirred&mdash;<br />
Yea, shook the Universe.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thanksgiving for the Mighty Hour<br />
That brimmed the Victor&rsquo;s cup,<br />
When England signalled to the foe,<br />
&lsquo;The German flag must be brought low<br />
And not again hauled up!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thanksgiving for the sea and air<br />
Free from the Devil&rsquo;s might!<br />
Thanksgiving that the human race<br />
Can lift once more a rev&rsquo;rent face,<br />
And say, &lsquo;God helps the Right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Thanksgiving for our men who came<br />
In Heaven-protected ships,<br />
The waning tide of hope to swell,<br />
With &lsquo;Lusitania&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cavell&rsquo;<br />
As watchwords on their lips.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thanksgiving that our splendid dead,<br />
All radiant with youth,<br />
Dwell near to us&mdash;there is no death.<br />
Thanksgiving for the broad new faith<br />
That helps us know this truth.</p>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES</h2>
<p class="poetry">I had seen our splendid soldiers in their khaki
uniforms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their leaders with a Sam Brown belt;<br />
I had seen the fighting Britons and Colonials in swarms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I had seen the blue-clad Frenchmen, and I felt<br />
That the mighty martial show<br />
Had no new sight to bestow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I walked on Piccadilly, and my word!<br />
By the bonnie Highland laddies<br />
In their kilts and their plaidies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a wholly new sensation I was stirred.</p>
<p class="poetry">They were like some old-time picture, or a
scene from out a play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were stalwart, they were young, and
debonnair;<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Their jaunty
little caps they wore in such a fetching way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they showed their handsome legs, and
didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;<br />
And they seemed to own the town<br />
As they strode on up and down&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, they surely were a sight for tired eyes!<br />
Those braw, bonnie laddies<br />
In their kilts and their plaidies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I stared at them with pleasure and surprise.</p>
<p class="poetry">I had read about the valour of old
Scotland&rsquo;s warrior sons&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How they fought to a finish, or else fell;<br />
I had heard the name bestowed on them by agitated Huns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who called these skirted soldiers &lsquo;Dames of
Hell&rsquo;;<br />
And I gave them right of way<br />
On their London holiday,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I met them swinging down the street and
Strand,<br />
Those bonnie, bonnie laddies<br />
In their kilts and their plaidies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I breathed a blessing on them and their land</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Now the world is all rejoicing that the end of war has
come&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no heart is any gladder than my own,<br />
That the brutal, blatant voices of the guns at last are dumb,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Dove of Peace from out her cage has
flown.<br />
Yet, when men no more march by,<br />
Making pictures for the eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a vital dash of colour earth will
lack,<br />
When the brave Highland laddies<br />
Drop their kilts and their plaidies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And return to common clothes of grey or black!</p>

<p class="poetry">To the splendid heroes of Jutland Bank<br />
And the Royal Navy I give their due;<br />
And cheek by jowl with them all, I rank<br />
The brave mine-sweepers and merchant crew.</p>
<p class="poetry">Trawler&mdash;Drifter&mdash;or English
Fleet&mdash;<br />
All are manned by the Men of the Sea,<br />
And all together in my heart meet,<br />
For a boat is a boat to the mind of me.</p>
<p class="poetry">And who ever over the dread seas fared,<br />
And however humble his work or place,<br />
To the great Christ spirit must be compared&mdash;<br />
Since he offered his life for the good of the race.</p>
<p class="poetry">And how many lie in the deep-sea bed,<br />
No man can reckon, and no man number;<br />
But not one Soul of them all is dead,<br />
For death is only the body&rsquo;s slumber.</p>

With horror, were he not already hoary<br />
At sight of this vile monster, foul and gory.<br />

Yet oft when the shadows darken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the daylight hides its face,<br />
The soul of me seems to hearken<br />

And the monster of war is hated,<br />

Through &aelig;ons and &aelig;ons, his story<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is bloody and blackened with crime;<br />
But he will come out into glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stand on the summits sublime.</p>
<p class="poetry">He will stand on the summits of Knowledge,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; In the splendour of Light from the Source;<br />
And the methods of church and of college<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will all of them change by his force.<br />
For the creeds that are blind and cruel,<br />

I will go homeless into homes of grieving,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Where all was mourning, I would cease to mourn.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now I am here, close to the great

Our dead dwell near, life is a thing eternal:<br />

The need of prayer&mdash;<br />
Such lonely moments, knowing not anywhere,<br />

In all the far recesses of vast space,<br />
Dwells any one to whom His prayers may rise,<br />
And then, methinks&mdash;so urgent is His need&mdash;<br />

CRIMES OF PEACE</h2>
<p class="poetry">Musing upon the tragedies of earth,<br />
Of each new horror which each hour gives birth,<br />
Of sins that scar and cruelties that blight<br />
Life&rsquo;s little season, meant for man&rsquo;s delight,<br />
Methought those monstrous and repellent crimes<br />
Which hate engenders in war-heated times,<br />
To God&rsquo;s great heart bring not so much despair<br />
As other sins which flourish everywhere<br />
And in all times&mdash;bold sins, bare-faced and proud,<br />
Unchecked by college, and by Church allowed,<br />
Lifting their lusty heads like ugly weeds<br />
Above wise precepts and religious creeds,<br />
And growing rank in prosperous days of peace.<br />
Think you the evils of this world would cease<br />
With war&rsquo;s cessation?<br />

Yea; there are mean, lean sins God must abhor<br />
More than the fatted, blood-drunk monster, War.<br />
Looking from His place, looking from His high place among the
stars, God saw a peaceful land&mdash;<br />
A land of fertile fields and golden harvests&mdash;and great
cities whose innumerable spires pierced the vault of heaven, like
bayonets of an invading army.<br />
And God said, speaking unto Himself aloud, God said:<br />
&lsquo;Peace and power and plenty have I given unto this land;
and those tall steeples are monuments to Me.<br />
Now let My people reveal themselves, that I may see their works,
done in My name in a fertile land of peace.<br />
I will withdraw Mine eyes from other worlds that I may behold
them, that I may behold these people to whom I sent
Christ&mdash;they whose innumerable spires pierce My blue vault
like bayonets.&rsquo;<br />
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>God saw

They played at sports; they played at love; they played at being
gay.<br />
They were but empty, silk-clad shells; their souls had leaked
away.<br />
He saw the sweat-shop and the mill where little children
toiled,<br />
The sunless rooms where mothers slaved and unborn souls were
spoiled;<br />
While those whose greedy, selfish lives had thrust the toilers
there,<br />
He saw whirled down broad avenues, clothed all with raiment
fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">He saw in homes made beautiful with all that
gold can give<br />
Unhappy souls at odds with life, not knowing how to live.<br />
He saw fair, pampered women turn from motherhood&rsquo;s sweet
joy,<br />
Obsessed with methods to prevent or mania to destroy.<br />
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>He saw men
sell their souls to vice and avarice and greed;<br />

<p class="poetry">He saw bold little children come from church

To suffering of lesser things, unfeeling and unkind;<br />
He heard them taunt the poor, and tease their furred and

And no voice spake from home or church to tell them this was
sin.<br />
He heard the cry of wounded things, the wasteful gun&rsquo;s
report;<br />
He saw the morbid craze to kill, which Christian men called
sport.</p>

She led a jubilant, joy-seeking band about the riant earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Do you recall those laughing days, my

Yet women whose sweet mouth had never sipped<br />

<i>To bring back comfort to the stricken house</i><br />

<p class="poetry">In its long widowhood the world has striven<br

To find diversion.&nbsp; It has turned away<br />
From the vast aweful silences of Heaven<br />
(Which answer but with silence when we pray)<br />
And sought for something to assuage its grief.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some surcease and relief<br />
From sorrow, in pursuit of mortal joys.<br />
It drowned God&rsquo;s stillness in a sea of noise;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell bent on slaughter,<br />
All these plough paths for widows.&nbsp; Maids at dawn,<br />
And brides at noon, ere eventide pass on<br />
Into the ranks of widows: but to weep<br />
Just for a little space; then will grief sleep<br />
In their young bosoms, where sweet hope belongs,<br />
New love will sing once more its age-old songs,<br />
And life bloom as a rose-tree blooms again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a night of rain.<br />
There are complacent widows clothed in cr&ecirc;pe<br />
Who simulate a grief that is not real.<br />
Through paths of seeming sorrow they escape<br />
From disappointed hopes to some ideal,<br />
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Or, from
the penury of unloved wives<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one wild burst,<br />
And then go lilting lightly down the years:<br />
Black butterflies, they flit from flower to flower<br />
And live in the thin pleasures of the hour;<br />
Merging their tender memories of the dead<br />
In tenderer dreams of being once more wed.</p>
<p class="poetry">But there are others: women who have proved<br

That loving greatly means so being loved.<br />
Women who through full beauteous years have grown<br />
Into the very body, souls, and heart<br />

Such close-knit bonds as these, and one alone<br />
Out to the larger freer life is called,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one is left&mdash;<br />
Then God in heaven must sometimes be appalled<br />
At the wild anguish of the soul bereft,<br />
And unto His Son must say, &lsquo;I did not know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mortals could suffer
so.&rsquo;</p>

Save the sweet certitude that each long day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is one step in a stair<br />
That circles up to where freed spirits stay.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And opportunities of being thrown<br />
In contact with the cultured and the gifted people of the day.<br

I deemed it wise to keep apart and let the others have their

word<br />

For speculation.&nbsp; (One man who had made<br />

cause,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quite deplored the fact that wars must come.<br

Of profit might be to a land of peace,<br />
And wondered if times would be harder should war cease.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, my Brother.</p>
<p class="poetry">And after he finds it, what is the end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, O Brother?<br />
Upward ever its course and trend;<br />
For this is the purpose and aim and plan<br />
To seek in the soul for the Super-man&mdash;<br />
The man who is conscious that Heaven is near&mdash;<br />
A bulletin bearer from There to Here,<br />
Finding God dwells in the spirit within<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where He ever has been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, my Brother.</p>
<p class="poetry">And what will the God-man do when He comes,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, O Brother?<br />
He will better the world or in courts or slums,<br />
He will do in gladness his nearest duty:<br />
He will teach the religion of love and beauty<br />
In field or factory, mine or mart,<br />
While He tells the world of the larger part<br />
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>And the
wider life that is yet to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When spirit is free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, my Brother.</p>
<p class="poetry">When spirit is free, then where will it go,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, O Brother?<br />
Its uttermost summit no man may know,<br />
For it goes up to God in His holy Tower<br />
To gather more knowledge and force and power;<br />
Like a ray of the sun it shall shine again<br />
To brighten new planets and races of men.<br />
Life had no beginning, life has no end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother and friend&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother, my Brother.</p>

IS IT?</h2>
<p class="poetry"><i>You who are loudly crying out for
peace</i>,<br />
<i>You who are wanting love to vanquish hate</i>,<br />
<i>How is it in the four walls of your home</i><br />
<i>The while you wait</i>?</p>
<p class="poetry">Do those who form your household welcome your
approach in the morning<br />
As the earth welcomes the presence of dawn,<br />
Or do they dread your coming lest you censure and complain?<br />
Do you begin the day with praise to God for each blessing you
possess, and do you speak frequent words of commendation to those
about you?<br />
Do those you claim to love often hear you talking in love&rsquo;s
language,<br />
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Or is
your softest tone and your sweetest speech saved for the sometime

return</i><br />
<i>And for the coming of the Promised Day</i>,<br />
<i>How is it in the four walls of your home</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The while you pray</i>?</p>
<p class="poetry">Are you trying to make your home a reflection
of what you believe heaven will be?<br />
Unless you are you will never find heaven anywhere;<br />
The foundations of our heavenly mansions must first be built on
earth.<br />
Unless you are striving to put in use some of the angelic virtues
here and now,<br />
No angelhood will be accorded you hereafter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Unless you are illustrating your desire for
peace by a peaceful, love-ruled home,<br />
You have no right to clamour for a cessation of hostilities among
nations;<br />
Nations are only chains of individuals.<br />
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>When
each individual expresses nothing but love and peace in his daily
life, there will be no more war.</p>

<p class="poetry">For the courage which comes when we call,<br />
While troubles like hailstones fall;<br />
For the help that is somehow nigh,<br />
In the deepest night when we cry;<br />
For the path that is certainly shown<br />
When we pray in the dark alone,<br />

If we look under wrong for the right;<br />
For the gleam of the ultimate goal<br />
That shines on each reverent soul:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us give thanks.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the consciousness stirring in creeds<br />
That love is the thing the world needs;<br />
For the cry of the travailing earth<br />
That is giving a new faith birth;<br />

Like a plant in the soil and the rain;<br />
For the dropping of needless things<br />
Which the sword of a sorrow brings;<br />
For the meaning and purpose of life<br />
Which dawns on us out of the strife:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us give thanks.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the solace that comes to our grief<br />
In knowing earth&rsquo;s season is brief;<br />
For the certitude given by faith<br />
Of the continents out beyond death;<br />
For the glorious thought that each day<br />
Is speeding us the reward away:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us give thanks.</p>

BLACK SHEEP</h2>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<i>Black sheep</i>, <i>black sheep</i>,
<i>have you any wool</i>?&rsquo;<br />
<i>Yes</i>, <i>sir</i>&mdash;<i>yes</i>, <i>sir</i>: <i>three
bags full</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want any New
Thought,&rsquo; said he,<br />
&lsquo;Or any Theosophy, for, you see,<br />
The faith I learned at my mother&rsquo;s knee<br />
Is good enough for me.<br />
Of course, I&rsquo;m a wee bit broader than she,<br />
Hearing one sermon where she heard three,<br />
And I read my paper on Sunday, instead<br />
Of the Bible only.&nbsp; My mother said<br />
I was a black sheep, when she saw<br />
I strayed a trifle away from the law,<br />
And didn&rsquo;t think every one left in the lurch<br />
Who happened to go to a different church;<br />
But, still, in the main, her creed is mine,<br />
And I don&rsquo;t want anything more divine.&rsquo;<br />
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Yet his
mother&rsquo;s mother was more austere;<br />
She taught her children a creed of fear,<br />
And she called them &lsquo;black sheep&rsquo; when, with a
shock,<br />
She saw them straying away from the flock,<br />
Just far enough<br />
To get around places they thought too rough,<br />
Like infant damnation and endless hell.</p>
<p class="poetry">But his mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s mother
would tell<br />
How her mother thought it was God&rsquo;s sweet will<br />
To punish and torture a heretic till<br />
They drove out the devil that made him dare<br />
Think for himself in the matter of prayer<br />
And faith and salvation.&nbsp; So we see how it is<br />
If we look back over the centuries&mdash;<br />
The creeds men learned at their mother&rsquo;s knee<br />
When Salem witches were hanged to a tree,<br />
And the pious dames flocked thither to see,<br />
Are not deemed Christian or holy to-day;<br />
And the bold black sheep who went straying away<br />
From rut-worn paths in their search for God,<br />
And leaped over the fence into pastures broad,<br />
Are the great trail-makers for mortal souls,<br />
Leading the race up to higher goals<br />
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>And a
larger religion; where man must find<br />
God dwelling ever within his mind,<br />
Christ in his conduct, and heaven in his thought,<br />
And hell but the places where love is not.<br />
A mighty religion that makes this earth<br />
But the cradle that fits us for death&rsquo;s new birth<br />
And the life beyond it, that is so near<br />
Its echoes may reach to the listening ear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<i>Black sheep</i>, <i>black sheep</i>,
<i>have you any wool</i>?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;<i>Yes</i>, <i>sir</i>&mdash;<i>yes</i>, <i>sir</i>: <i>a

<p class="poetry">Little by little and one by one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the ether, were worlds created;<br />
Star and planet and sea and sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All in the nebulous Nothing waited<br />
Till the Nameless One Who has many a name<br />
Called them to being and forth they came.</p>
<p class="poetry">All things mighty and all things small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stone and flower and sentient being,<br />
Each is an answer to that one call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A part of Himself that His will is freeing&mdash;<br
/>
Freeing to go on the long, long way<br />
That winds back home at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Little by little does mortal man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Build his castles for joy and glory,<br />
And one by one time shatters each plan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lowers his palaces, story by story&mdash;<br />
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Story by
story, till earth is just<br />
A row of graves in the lowly dust.</p>
<p class="poetry">One by one, whatever was called,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be called back to the primal Centre.<br />
Let no soul tremble or be appalled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the heart of the Maker is where we
enter&mdash;<br />
Is where we enter to gain new force<br />
Before we are sent on another course.</p>
<p class="poetry">And one by one, as He calls us back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall find the souls that we loved with
passion,<br />
In the great way-stations along the track,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And clasp them again in the old, sweet
fashion&mdash;<br />
In the old, sweet fashion when earth we trod&mdash;<br />
And journey along with them up to God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Lord</i>, <i>let us
pray</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">Give us the open mind, O God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind that dares believe<br />
In paths of thought as yet untrod;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind that can conceive<br />
Large visions of a wider way<br />
Than circumscribes our world to-day.</p>
<p class="poetry">May tolerance temper our own faith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; However great our zeal;<br />
When others speak of life and death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not plunge a steel<br />
Into the heart of one who talks<br />
In terms we deem unorthodox.</p>
<p class="poetry">Help us to send our thoughts through space,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Where worlds in trillions roll,<br />
Each fashioned for its time and place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each portion of the whole;<br />
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Till our
weak minds may feel a sense<br />
Of Thy Supreme Omnipotence.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let us not shame Thee with a creed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That builds a costly church,<br />
But blinds us to a brother&rsquo;s need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he dares to search<br />
For truth in his own soul and heart<br />
And finds his church in home and mart.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Give us the faith that makes us kind</i>,<br

<i>Give us the open sight and mind</i>&mdash;<br />

<h2><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>BE
NOT DISMAYED</h2>
<p class="poetry">Be not dismayed, be not dismayed when death<br
/>
Sets its white seal upon some worshipped face.<br />
Poor human nature for a little space<br />
Must suffer anguish, when that last drawn breath<br />
Leaves such long silence; but let not thy faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fail for a moment in God&rsquo;s boundless grace.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But know, oh know, He has prepared a place<br />
Fairer for our dear dead than worlds beneath,<br />
Yet not beneath; for those entrancing spheres<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Surround our earth as seas a barren isle.<br />
Ours is the region of eternal fears;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Theirs is the region where God&rsquo;s radiant
smile<br />
Shines outward from the centre, and gives hope<br />
Even to those who in the shadows grope.<br />
They are not far from us.&nbsp; At first though long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lone may seem the paths that intervene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever on the staff of prayer we lean<br />
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>The
silence will grow eloquent with song<br />
And our weak faith with certitude wax strong.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Intense, yet tranquil; fervent, yet serene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He must be who would contact World Unseen<br />
And comrade with their Amaranthine throng;<br />
Not through the tossing waves of surging grief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come spirit-ships to port.&nbsp; When storms
subside,<br />
Then with their precious cargoes of relief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the harbour of the heart they glide.<br />
For him who will believe and trust and wait<br />
Death&rsquo;s austere silence grows articulate.</p>

118</span>ASCENSION</h2>
<p class="poetry">I have been down in the darkest water&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep, deep down where no light could pierce;<br />
Alone with the things that are bent on slaughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mindless things that are cruel and fierce.<br />
I have fought with fear in my wave-walled prison,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And begged for the beautiful boon of death;<br />
But out of the billows my soul has risen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To glorify God with my latest breath.</p>
<p class="poetry">There is no potion I have not tasted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the bitters in life&rsquo;s large store;<br
/>
And never a drop of the gall was wasted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the lords of Karma saw fit to pour,<br />
Though I cried as my Elder Brother before me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Father in heaven, let pass this
cup!&rsquo;<br />
And the only response from the still skies o&rsquo;er me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the brew held close for my lips to sup.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>Yet I have grown strong on the gall Elysian,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a courage has come that all things dares;<br />
And I have been given an inner vision<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the wonderful world where my dear one fares;<br
/>
And I have had word from the great Hereafter&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A marvellous message that throbs with truth,<br />
And mournful weeping has changed to laughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And grief has changed into the joy of youth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! there was a time when I supped sweet
potions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lightly uttered profound belief,<br />
Before I went down in the swirling oceans<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fought with madness and doubt and grief.<br />
Now I am climbing the Hills of Knowledge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I speak unfearing, and say &lsquo;I
know,&rsquo;<br />
Though it be not to church, or to book, or college,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But to God Himself that my debt I owe.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the ceaseless prayer of a soul is
heeded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the prayer asks only for light and faith;<br />
And the faith and the light and the knowledge needed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall gild with glory the path to death.<br />
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Oh!
heart of the world by sorrow shaken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear ye the message I have to give:<br />
The seal from the lips of the dead is taken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they can say to you, &lsquo;Lo! we
live.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>THE
DEADLIEST SIN</h2>
<p class="poetry">There are not many sins when once we sift
them.<br />
In actions of evolving human souls<br />
Striving to reach high goals<br />
And falling backward into dust and mire,<br />
Some element we find that seems to lift them<br />
Above our condemnation&mdash;even higher<br />
Into the realm of pity and compassion.<br />
So beauteous a thing as love itself can fashion<br />
A chain of sins; descending to desire,<br />
It wanders into dangerous paths, and leads<br />
To most unholy deeds,<br />
And light-struck, walks in madness toward the night.</p>
<p class="poetry">Wrong oft-times is an over-ripened right,<br />
A rank weed grown from some neglected flower,<br />
The lightning uncontrolled: flames meant for joy<br />
And beauty, used to ravage and destroy.<br />
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>For sins
like these repentance can atone.<br />
There is one sin alone<br />
Which seems all unforgivable, because<br />
It springs from no temptation and no need<br />
And no desire, save to make sweet faith bleed,<br />
And to defame God&rsquo;s laws.<br />
Oh! viler than the murderer or the thief<br />
Who slays the body and who robs the purse,<br />
Is he who strives to kill the mind&rsquo;s belief<br />
And rob it of its hope<br />
Of life beyond this little pain-filled span.<br />
God has no curse<br />
Quite dark enough to punish such a man,<br />
Who, seeing how souls grope<br />
And suffer in this world of mighty losses,<br />
And how hearts stagger on beneath life&rsquo;s crosses,<br />
Yet strives to rob them of their staff of faith<br />
And make them think dark death<br />
Ends all existence; think the worshipped child<br />
Cold in its mother&rsquo;s arms is but a clod<br />
And has not gone to God;<br />
That souls united by love undefiled<br />
And holy can by death be torn asunder<br />
To meet no more.<br />
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>It must
be true that under<br />
This earth of ours there lies a Purgatory<br />
For those who seek to rob grief of the glory<br />
That shines through hope of life immortal.&nbsp; In<br />
Sin&rsquo;s lexicon this is the vilest sin&mdash;<br />
Needless and cruel, ugly, gaunt and mean,<br />
Without one poor excuse on which to lean,<br />
A vandal sin, that with no hope of gain<br />
Finds pleasure only in another&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">God! though all other sins on earth persist,<br
/>
Strike dumb the blatant, loud-mouthed atheist.</p>
<h2><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>THE
RAINBOW OF PROMISE</h2>
<p class="poetry">In the face of the sun are great thunderbolts
hurled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the storm-clouds have shut out its light;<br />
But a Rainbow of Promise now shines on the world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the universe thrills at the sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis the flag of our Union, the red,
white, and blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Star-spangled Banner&mdash;our pride;<br />
Fair symbol of all that is noble and true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flung out over continents wide.</p>
<p class="poetry">Flung out in its glory o&rsquo;er land and
o&rsquo;er sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a message from God in each star;<br />
And a glorious promise of peace yet to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fluttering folds of each bar.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it may have been,<br />
This is our slogan, and this our vow&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall not win, they shall not win.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though out of the darkness they call the aid<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the evil forces of Sin,<br />
We utter our slogan unafraid&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall not win, they shall not win.</p>
<p class="poetry">We know we are right, and know they are

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
